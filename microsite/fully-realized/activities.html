                  <h2>Activities of Yosemite</h2>
                  <p>
                    Yosemite National Park is open year-round, though certain roads close during snowy months, usually from November 
                    through May or June. Certain trails also close during winter, including The 4-Mile Trail and part of The Mist Trail.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    Traffic congestion in the valley is heavy during the peak summer season (June to August), and a free shuttle bus 
                    system operates in the valley. Parking in the valley during the summer is often full. Amtrak and the Yosemite 
                    Area Regional Transportation System (YARTS) provide public transit into Yosemite from four gateway communities: 
                    Merced, Fresno, Sonora, and Mammoth Lakes/Lee Vining. The Merced route provides service year-round.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The natural and cultural history of Yosemite Valley is presented at the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center, the adjoining 
                    Yosemite Museum, and the Nature Center at Happy Isles. The parks' two National Historic Landmarks are the Sierra Club's 
                    LeConte Memorial Lodge (Yosemite's first public visitor center), and the Ahwahnee Hotel. Camp 4 is on the National Register 
                    of Historic Places.

    <h2>Hiking</h2>
    <p>
        Over 800 miles (1,300 km) of trails are available to hikers—everything from an easy stroll to a challenging mountain hike, or 
        backpacking trips. The popular Half Dome hike to the summit of Half Dome requires a permit whenever the cables are up (usually from 
        Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day). A maximum of 300 hikers, selected by lottery, are permitted to advance beyond the base 
        of the subdome each day, including 225 day hikers and 75 backpackers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The park can be divided into five sections—Yosemite Valley, Wawona/Mariposa Grove/Glacier Point, Tuolumne Meadows, Hetch Hetchy, and 
        Crane Flat/White Wolf. Numerous books describe park trails, while the National Park Service provides free information.
