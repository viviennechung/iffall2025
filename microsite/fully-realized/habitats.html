                  <h2>Habitats of Yosemite</h2>
                  <p>
                    The park has an elevation range from 2,127 to 13,114 feet (648 to 3,997 m) and contains five major vegetation zones: 
                    chaparral and oak woodland, lower montane forest, upper montane forest, subalpine zone, and alpine. Of California's 
                    7,000 plant species, approximately 50% occur in the Sierra Nevada, and more than 20% within the park. The park contains 
                    suitable habitat for more than 160 rare plants, with rare local geologic formations and unique soils characterizing the 
                    restricted ranges many of these plants occupy.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    With its scrubby sun-baked chaparral, stately groves of pine, fir, and sequoia, and expanses of alpine woodlands and 
                    meadows, Yosemite National Park preserves a Sierra landscape as it prevailed before Euro-American settlement.
                    In contrast to surrounding lands, which have been significantly altered by logging, the park contains some 352.36 sq mi 
                    (912.6 km2) of old-growth forest. Taken together, the park's varied habitats support over 250 species of vertebrates, 
                    which include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals.

    <h2>Wildlife</h2>
    <p>
        Yosemite's western boundary has habitats dominated by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, incense cedar, 
        white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. These habitats 
        support relatively high wildlife diversity. Wildlife include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, 
        white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and bats.
    </p>
    <p>
        At higher elevations, the coniferous forests become purer stands of red fir, western white pine, Jeffrey pine, lodgepole pine, 
        and the occasional foxtail pine. Fewer wildlife species tend to be found in these habitats because of their higher elevation and 
        lower complexity. Animals include golden-mantled ground squirrel, chickaree, fisher, Steller's jay, water ouzel, hermit thrush, 
        and American goshawk. Reptiles are not common, but include rubber boa, western fence lizard, and northern alligator lizard.
