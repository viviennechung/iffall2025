                  <h2>Geography of Yosemite</h2>
                  <p>
                    Yosemite National Park is located in the central Sierra Nevada. Three wilderness areas are adjacent to Yosemite: 
                    the Ansel Adams Wilderness to the southeast, the Hoover Wilderness to the northeast, and the Emigrant Wilderness 
                    to the north.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    The 1,189 sq mi (3,080 km2) park contains thousands of lakes and ponds, 1,600 miles (2,600 km) of streams, 
                    800 miles (1,300 km) of hiking trails, and 350 miles (560 km) of roads.[79] Two federally designated Wild and 
                    Scenic Rivers, the Merced and the Tuolumne, begin within Yosemite's borders and flow westward through the Sierra 
                    foothills into the Central Valley of California.

    <h2>Rocks and Erosion</h2>
    <p>
        Almost all of the landforms are cut from the granitic rock of the Sierra Nevada Batholith (a batholith is a large mass of intrusive 
        igneous rock that formed deep below the surface). About five percent of the park's landforms (mostly in its eastern margin near Mount 
        Dana) are metamorphosed volcanic and sedimentary rocks. These roof pendants once formed the roof over the underlying granitic magma.
    </p>
    <p>
        Erosion acting upon different types of uplift-generated joint and fracture systems is responsible for producing the valleys, 
        canyons, domes, and other features. These joints and fracture systems do not move, and are therefore not faults. Spacing between 
        joints is controlled by the amount of silica in the granite and granodiorite rocks; more silica tends to form a more resistant 
        rock, resulting in larger spaces between joints and fractures.

      <h2>Popular Features</h2>
      <p>
        Yosemite Valley represents only one percent of the park area. The Tunnel View gives a view of the valley. El Capitan is a 
        prominent granite cliff that looms over the valley, and is a rock climbing favorite because of its sheer size, diverse climbing 
        routes, and year-round accessibility. Granite domes such as Sentinel Dome and Half Dome rise 3,000 and 4,800 feet (910 and 1,460 m), 
        respectively, above the valley floor. The park contains dozens of other granite domes.
      </p>

        The high country of Yosemite contains other important features such as Tuolumne Meadows, Dana Meadows, the Clark Range, the 
        Cathedral Range, and the Kuna Crest. The Sierra Crest and the Pacific Crest Trail run through Yosemite. Mount Dana and Mount 
        Gibbs are peaks of red metamorphic rock. Granite peaks include Mount Conness, Cathedral Peak, and Matterhorn Peak. Mount Lyell 
        is the highest point in the park, standing at 13,120 feet (4,000 m). The Lyell Glacier is the largest glacier in the park and 
        one of the few remaining in the Sierra.
