                  <h2>Ahwahneechee and the Mariposa Wars</h2>
                  <p>
                    The first humans of Yosemite were the Ahwahneechee, meaning “dwellers” in Ahwahnee. They were the only 
                    tribe living within the park boundaries, with other nearby tribes forming the larger Southern Sierra Miwok 
                    population. Their blended culture helped preserve their presence despite early American settlement and development 
                    pressures.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    During conflict with settlers and miners, the Mariposa Battalion—led by James Savage and Captain John Boling—drove 
                    the Ahwahneechee from Yosemite in 1851, capturing tribe members including Chief Tenaya. Some escaped, others were 
                    relocated to reservations, and Tenaya and many remaining Ahwahneechee later joined the Mono Lake Paiutes. After Tenaya’s 
                    death in 1853, surviving Ahwahneechee were absorbed into neighboring tribes. Native people continued living in Yosemite 
                    in smaller numbers, adapting by working in tourism and local trade. In 1953 the National Park Service banned non-employee 
                    Natives from living in the park, and in 1969 the last Native residents were evicted and their village destroyed. A reconstructed 
                    “Indian Village of Ahwahnee” now stands near the Yosemite Museum.
                  </p>
          
                  <p>
                    By the late 1800s, only a few dozen to several hundred Native people remained. The last full-blooded Ahwahneechee, 
                    Totuya (Maria Lebrado), granddaughter of Chief Tenaya, died in 1931. Their legacy continues through descendants, 
                    museum exhibits, and cultural preservation efforts. Treaties proposed by Indigenous groups in 1851–1852 were never 
                    ratified. Today, the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation continues seeking federal recognition, and National Park Service 
                    policies now aim to protect sacred sites and allow Native people to return and use park lands.

    <h2>Establishment & Preservation</h2>
    <p>
        Yosemite played a key role in the birth of the U.S. National Park idea. In 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the 
        Yosemite Grant, protecting the valley and Mariposa Grove. In 1890, influenced by conservationist John Muir, Yosemite 
        became a National Park and later came under National Park Service management. The park inspired early conservation laws 
        and helped launch the national parks system.
    </p>
    <h2>Tourism</h2>
    <p>
        Tourism to Yosemite began in the mid-1800s and expanded with stage roads and railroads. Early hotels, camps, and concessions 
        developed to serve visitors, including Camp Curry and the Ahwahnee Hotel. Today, Yosemite welcomes millions of visitors annually, 
        most drawn to Yosemite Valley’s dramatic natural sights.
