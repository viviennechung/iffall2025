            <h1>Recipe: Lemon Coconut Drop Shortbread Cookies</h1>

                <p>
                    Lemon Coconut Drop Shortbread Cookies  are like snowball cookies but with glaze instead of a powdered sugar coating. 
                    They are buttery and light with a tender, yet crumbly shortbread-style texture. Top with smooth lemon glaze plus a 
                    garnish of coconut or sprinkles to make a beautiful two-bite cookie.
                </p>

                        <li>1 cup unsalted butter</li>

                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finely chop or pulse the sweetened shredded coconut so the pieces are smaller.</li>
                    <li>In a mixer with paddle: beat softened butter about 1 minute until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Add powdered sugar, vanilla, coconut extract, and lemon zest; beat until combined. Scrape bowl.</li>
                    <li>Add lemon juice, salt, the chopped coconut, and flour; mix until a thick dough comes together (it may look crumbly at first—keep mixing).</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl and chill the dough 30 minutes (up to 3 days). If chilled longer than ~2 hours, let it sit out 30 minutes before rolling.</li>
                    <li>Heat oven to 350°F. Line baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats.</li>
                    <li>Roll dough into 1-Tablespoon balls and set 2 inches apart. If dough seems crumbly, keep rolling—warmth of hands helps it bind.</li>
                    <li>Bake 14–15 minutes, until the bottoms are just lightly golden.</li>
                    <li>Cool on the sheet 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack. Let cookies cool completely before glazing.</li>
                </ol>

            <h2>Recipe Website Reference</h2>
                <li><a href="https://pinchofyum.com/">Pinch of Yum</a></li>
                Pinch of Yum is a visually engaging food blog that I thought was very interactive and easy to follow for users. 
                The site’s high-quality photography and conversational writing style make it visually appealing. There were various 
                sections I could click onto, such as "Quick and Easy", "Vegetarian", "Meal Prep", etc, which I thought made it 
                super easy for users to find the type of meal they want to cook.                
                <li><a href="https://www.epicurious.com/">Epicurious</a></li>
                Epicurious feels very polished and professional, with bold typography and a magazine layout. The site integrates 
                videos and articles, making it feel like both a recipe hub and a culinary magazine. I enjoyed how clean the website 
                was, with the chosen typefaces and color palette.
                <li><a href="https://www.budgetbytes.com/">Budget Bytes</a></li>
                Budget Bytes emphasizes clarity and functionality, with a straightforward design that highlights cost per recipe 
                and serving. The site uses consistent color coding, clear icons, and a minimalist recipe card format that makes 
                information easy to scan. I liked the minimal and straightforward design style of this website.

            <h2>Non-Recipe Website Reference</h2>
            <li><a href="https://www.gemnote.com/">Gemnote</a></li>
            I liked the editorial-style typography with a subtle vintage feel to the website. It's clean and minimal, yet includes 
            a lot of stylistic choices on design.
            <li><a href="https://www.adidasarena.com/">Addidas Arena</a></li>
            I thought that the dynamic typography and layout played out nicely, creating an immersive experience for the users. I felt 
            that this website was very interactive and included nice micro animations.
            <li><a href="https://www.diko.co/">Diko</a></li>
            Although this website is a little chaotic, I thought that the maximalist concept worked very nicely to give this intentionally 
            messy, somewhat rebellious design system.
