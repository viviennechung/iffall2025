        <h1>TOO DEEP TO TURN BACK</h1>
        <h2>DANIEL CAESAR</h2>

        <br> 

        <p class="b">[Verse 1]</p>
        <p>So what's the price?</p>
        <p>We're like mosquitoes to light, in a sense</p>
        <p>I feed off bioluminescence</p>
        <p>Love and intent</p>
        <p>So it's a quick fix</p>
        <p>What else does life have to give but the pain</p>
        <p>Generated inside our own brains?</p>
        <p>It's a sick game, yeah</p>

        <br>

        <p class="b">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>Submit to me, come get down on one knee</p>
        <p>I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need</p>
        <p>(That you need)</p>
        <p>Submit to me, come get down on one knee</p>
        <p>I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need</p>

        <br>

        <p class="b">[Verse 2]</p>
        <p>Blaspheming the spirit</p>
        <p>I just don't want to hear it, too deep</p>
        <p>What I've sown I'll continue to reap</p>
        <p>I'll earn my keep</p>
        <p>It was all good intentions</p>
        <p>Did I forget to mention? My God</p>
        <p>Just tryna get money with my dogs</p>
        <p>Is that so wrong?</p>

        <br>

        <p class="b">[Chorus]</p>
        <p>Submit to me, come get down on one knee</p>
        <p>I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need</p>
        <p>(That you need)</p>
        <p>Submit to me, come get down on one knee</p>
        <p>I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need</p>

        <br>

        <p class="b">[Verse 3]</p>
        <p>Lately you've been on a wave</p>
        <p>Seen you lit up in the place</p>
        <p>Sometimes you're sad, I see it on your face</p>
        <p>I can tell you're not okay</p>
        <p>I know you're only seeking out the beauty</p>
        <p>In fulfilling your duty</p>
        <p>The answers it seems</p>
        <p>Are inside your own dreams</p>

        <br>

        <p class="b">[Verse 4]</p>
        <p>Good God, Jehovah, what's this I see?</p>
        <p>My mortality's staring back at me</p>
        <p>Like I ain't come prepared and I ain't know what this is</p>
        <p>I've slept like Jacob, a rock for a pillow</p>
        <p>Run swift like Elijah, away from the middle</p>
        <p>Seen the world, overindulged maybe a little</p>
        <p>But now your boy is up, and I'm fit as a fiddle</p>
        <p>Oh Lord, Jehovah, what's this I see?</p>
        <p>Bourgeoisie tryna silence me</p>
        <p>They don't know what I've been through</p>
        <p>Don't know what I pree'd</p>
        <p>Seen shit that you see up in your TV screen</p>
        <p>Follow me to salvation</p>
        <p>Your mind still 'pon plantations</p>
        <p>The shepherd, holds information</p>
        <p>Gives it out as its taken</p>
        <p>Yeah, yeah</p>
