        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>

        <ol>
            <li><p> Vivienne Chung, Communication Design, Junior</p>

            <li><p> I am a communication design student, so this course is required for me. However, I've worked on a few UX projects in Figma for prior courses. I'm excited to learn more through this course. </p>

            <li><p> I don't really have prior experience with HTML/CSS/JS. I did take CSE 131 in my freshman year, which was my only experience with coding. </p>

            <li><p> I want to learn more about HTML and CSS and become more comfortable with using them.</p>

            <li><p> Although it can be more complicated, I feel like designing for screen can be more flexible in a way than designing for paper. I can go back and adjust what needs to be fixed on screens. </p>

            <li> <p> <a href="https://lemmelive.com/">LemmeLive</a> is a website that exemplifies effective design. The color palette and stylistic choices make the brand identity strong.</p>

            <li><p> The <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> website exemplifies effective communication. Although the design is minimal, I thought it was straightforward to navigate as a user.</p>

            <li><p> <a href="https://www.notion.com/">Notion</a> is a good example, in my opinion, as a website that works well. It is a perfect mixture of design with effective communication.</p>
